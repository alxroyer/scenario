ReStructured Text indentation
=============================

ReStructured Text directives could lead to use indentations of 3 spaces.

Considering that this is hard to maintain with regular configurations of editors,
4 space indentations shall be preferred in docstrings and `.rst` files.

Exception for unordered and numbered lists that require the sub-content to be aligned with the bullet or item number.
