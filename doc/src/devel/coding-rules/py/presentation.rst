Presentation
============

.. todo:: Documentation needed for code presentation

    - Indentation:

      - Avoid right-aligned comments (hard to maintain when the names change)
      - Functions and methods (same purpose):

        - New line for the first parameter
        - Parameters indented with 2 tabs (as proposed by PyCharm by default).
          Makes it more readable by differenciating the parameters from the function / body.

    - Trailing commas (refer to PEP8 `<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#when-to-use-trailing-commas>`_)
    - New line after the opening parenthesis of the function declarations
