Presentation
============

.. todo:: Documentation needed for code presentation

    - Indentation:

      - 4 spaces (no tabulations)
      - Avoid right-aligned comments (avoids git diffs)
      - Functions and methods (same purpose):

        - New line for the first parameter (avoids git diffs).
        - Parameters indented with 8 spaces (common behaviour of well-known Python IDEs).
          Makes it more readable by differenciating the parameters from the function / body.

    - Trailing commas (refer to PEP8 `<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#when-to-use-trailing-commas>`_, avoids git diffs)
