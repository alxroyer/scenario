Scenario attributes
===================

.. todo:: Documentation needed for scenario attributes:

    - Core & user attributes.
    - Core attributes: short title and requirements.
    - Convention: attribute names in capital letters.
    - May commonly be used to manage additional info like: test title, test objective, names of features tested.
    - Expected scenario attributes.
    - Best practice: use of enums.
    - Best practice: overload `scenario.Scenario` with an initializer that requires your own scenario attributes.
    - ``--extra-info`` option, applicable for test and campaign launchers.
    - Extra info may be configured by default in your own launcher.
