# scenario

## Purpose

`scenario` is a test framework with the following key features:
- Test code reuse:
    - Quickly write tests by instanciating steps just as *legos*, sequencing them as scenarios.
    - Reuse existing scenarios as subscenario utils (initial conditions, transitions, ...)
- Powerful logging system.
- Handful configuration facilities.
- Test documentation definition along the test code.
- Rich assertion API, with evidence collection.
- Flexible known issue tracking.
- Campaign executions.
- Test reports.


## Documentation

Official publication for documentation still pending.

Meanwhile, please read through:
- [demo scripts](./demo/),
- [documentation sources](./doc/src/) (ReStructured Text).
